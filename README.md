# Traffic Sign Detection with YOLO üö¶üëÅÔ∏è

Welcome to our Traffic Sign Detection project using YOLO! This project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting and recognizing traffic signs in real-world scenarios. We utilize the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, a state-of-the-art deep learning approach, to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance.

## Key Features
‚úÖ Real-time traffic sign detection.
‚úÖ Support for a wide range of traffic signs.
‚úÖ High accuracy and precision in recognition.
‚úÖ Easy-to-use Python codebase.
‚úÖ Seamless integration with traffic monitoring systems.
